													<p>It is important to get the word out about how great a tutor/teacher Caroline is. We have used her for all 4 of our kids, from HS papers, college essays and also at the college level. She has an amazing ability to get right down to the level of each child and really draw out ideas and writing styles that have expanded my kids' writing ability into adulthood. They love to write! I am so thankful for Caroline and all she has done for my children. I highly recommend Caroline to anyone. She is an amazing educator.</p>

													<p>Working with Caroline was one of the best decisions I've ever made.  She helped me improve my ACT score when no one else could, and gave me all the necessary help to write successful college essays.  She's easy to get along with and provides a very comfortable learning environment.  I strongly recommend going to Caroline for any English or writing related needs. </p>

													<p>She is fabulous!!  We were referred to her for ACT test prep/strategies, and for assistance with college application essays.  My daughter saw her for some one-on-one tutoring, and also a small group session.  Caroline's depth of knowledge and experience with standardized testing was invaluable.  My daughter quickly developed a connection with Caroline and loved working with her which took so much of the "pain" out of the entire process.  My daughter's ACT test scores absolutely improved as a direct result.  Caroline's summer, small group, essay writing workshop also inspired and motivated my daughter. <br><br> Prior to the workshop she was having difficulty getting her essays started and developed beyond just ideas.  In the end they came out great.  Recently, a college admissions person from one of my daughter's "top choice schools" sent her a hand written note describing how moved he was by her essay.  We are grateful to Caroline and have NO hesitation recommending her to anyone.  I will definitely be contacting her again when my two younger children go through the college application process!</p>

													<p>Caroline helped all of my kids (3, 2 boys and a girl) with their test prep and most importantly their college essays.  All of my children liked working with her and found her assistance invaluable.  They all wrote great essays (and they wrote them, she guided and edited only) for their applications and got in to great schools.  
													<br><br>She also tutored them with AP English and ACT test prep and was equally skilled in helping them navigate through all the ins and out. They never complained and to this day speak highly of her and her guidance.
													Speaking as a parent she is communicative and very professional. 
													<br><br>One of the best in Marin.</p>

													<p>She is as knowledgeable as you can get, as well as being hilarious. Although I had a dud of a teacher for AP Comp, with Caroline's help, I managed to get a 5 on the AP Exam. She also helped tremendously through the college application process, I think in total we wrote 22 different essays. But for the first time in my life, I am actually satisfied with and proud of my writing thanks to her. Caroline has incredible knowledge and is also very good at sharing that knowledge with her students!</p>

													<p>Early on [in the college application process], my daughter and I had a few tense moments, but it quickly became apparent that the two of you had it under control.  She made all scheduled dates with time to spare.  Discussing the experience with her, she commented that you struck a nice balance in supporting her, but never taking over or overriding her during the process.  She understands that you provided her invaluable support, but at the same time is extremely proud of her essays.  You allowed her to own the process, the end result!</p>

													<p>Working with Ms. Hanssen throughout my college application process was one of the best decisions I have ever made. She was there with me every step of the way helping me write essays, tackle standardized testing strategies, and more. I don't think that I could have gotten into my top choice school without her. She was a joy to work with</p>

													<p>Caroline Hanssen has played an integral role in all my childrenâ€™s lives.  My oldest child started seeing Caroline in the fall of 2006 when he was a sophomore in high school.  He was not a strong writer and he knew that it was necessary to improve his writing to not only be successful in high school but in college as well. As a result of her help, he was able to pursue a journalism career at the Bark for two years while at Redwood. Caroline also helped to make the transition from high school writing to the much more demanding college level writing needs, something that any parent with college students will tell you is not easy.<br><br>
													Caroline was able to make this happen through her dedication to the simple goal of improving the writing and English skills of whomever she meets with. One way she is able to accomplish this is through her cooperative and courteous manner.  Although she is busy, her schedule is flexible, allowing for meetings to be made within a weekâ€™s notice. She never in my 6 years of knowing her has ever seemed rushed or overwhelmed. She is always able to connect with students on a level different than any other tutor.<br><br>
													Caroline truly understands that your child is there to become a better writer, but in a very encouraging and personable way, so it was a natural progression for my two daughters to start seeing her as well.  Caroline is very hands-on as a tutor.  She has a great rapport with teens and helps them find their voice.  She is able to communicate to teens to work for their own satisfaction, not just complete an assignment to finish it.<br><br>
													Caroline is especially knowledgeable and has versatility in many areas:  journalism, college application essays, SAT/ACT prep (excellent in critical reading and writing segments), even a graduation speech.  She also assisted my daughter in writing an appeal letter for college admission, which only had a 1% chance of admission.  The appeal letter was successful and my daughter was granted admission to that college!  She is an exceptional asset when it comes to writing essays for college applications.  She has a great understanding for what colleges are looking for in the personal statements.  She guides the student wonderfully through the college essay development, which can be a very stressful process.  <br><br>
													She has worked with all three of my children in all of these areas, and has taught them skills to flourish in college.  Even with two children in college miles away she is still accessible to them, which is very comforting for a parent. She goes above and beyond any of my expectations.</p>
